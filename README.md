An information Systems and Network Management student of James Sprunt Community College. I have been able to study CCNA, Networking, Network Security and know about the OSI model where the TCP/IP lays in the forth layer of the Transport(Segment) together with the other layers. I have been blessed to have join the I.T Department of the college to work and understand the working environment and volunteered to changed or replaced seven old swtiches with new FortiSwitches, networked old and new computers to the domain of the school, reimaged computers and assigned the name to the server, the classroom and the instructor. I have also replaced approximately 400 hard drives with solid state drives, reassembled computers in different offices and managed the cable neatly. Currently, I am working with a third part company named Ebryit as a Field Project Technician for Onslow County School District where I take an empty case of a laptop and build a new operating laptop from scratch.  I also change or replace system motherboards, Fans, Bezels, LCD, WLAN, Keyboards, Batteries and all that needs to be changed or replaced. It is a great experience for me. I am also passionate about Data Analytics. I like working with SQL and Tableau. I recently started working with PowerBI and absolutely love it. https://www.linkedin.com/in/george-koufie/
